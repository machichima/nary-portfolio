## Introduction

Use pre-trained Vision Transformer(ViT) for pCR rate prediction for breast cancer with MRI images, combined with extra information such as clinical data. 

Statistical analysis methods are used to perform the feature selection, extracting features with high effect on the pCR prediction.

The results from ViT model are compared with simpler machine learning models to further prove the robustness of applying ViT model in medical images.
